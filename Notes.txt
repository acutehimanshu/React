## Arrow function bind with this implicitly --- very Import POINT

You can use Visual Studio code
- Intellisense extention for support

if we use const [aaa,bbb] = React.useState("Title"); 
then we have to use function in place of class for components

by default main componenet render two times (due to strict mode)
if you disabled StrictMode in index.js page it will render one times
but we will go for StrictMode mode, in development mode it render two time, 
1ts time validate the code
2nd time render the code 
but in development mode it will work once only there will not validation in production.
rerender happend when state changes

Oracle Connection : 
connection = await oracle.getConnection({
    user: "hr",
    password: "hr",
    connectionString: "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=xepdb1)))"
});
or
const connectionString = {
        "user":"hr", 
        "password":'hr', 
        "connectionString":"//localhost:1521/xepdb1"
    };

connection string might be like sqlplus hr/hr@//localhost:1521/xepdb1

When your server is on different port and client is on different port then 
we will get error
access to fetch at URL has been blocked by CORS policies. 
CORS policies means : 
Same Origin Policy : means application source and will send and recieve the request. 
but when source and reciver are different then CORS Error will occur. 
to avoid this policy we will use proxy as of now 
/*
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5050/placements' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
*/
// it means in place of not Actual
in package.json 
at last 
"proxy":"http://localhost:5050"

When rerendeing happend then why const [title, setTitle] = React.useState("some data") is not rerending? 
due to React.useState -> some database created in backend in that "some data" ki entry ho jati he 
when is rerender fiest check in backend in ds , but in ds already setTitle is availe and us k againest 
if values is changed then this line will not execute. that means portion will execute but that valye will not update. 

now i want whenever state change we have to call function , how? 

React.useEffect(()=>{}, []) // New hook 
                ( functionality, [list of elements on which we want to execute functionality on change])
                if passes [] then it will execute only once. 

Initially it will execute only one. 

React.useEffect(()=>{
    getPlacements().then((emps)=>{
        setEmployees(emps);
    });
},[]);

Create table in DB
create table student ( id  int primary key, name char(25) not null, job_type char(1) not null, company char(25) not null, 
salary int not null, salary_type char(1) not null)
