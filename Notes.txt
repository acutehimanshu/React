You can use Visual Studio code
- Intellisense extention for support

if we use const [aaa,bbb] = React.useState("Title"); 
then we have to use function in place of class for components

by default main componenet render two times (due to strict mode)
if you disabled StrictMode in index.js page it will render one times
but we will go for StrictMode mode, in development mode it render two time, 
1ts time validate the code
2nd time render the code 
but in development mode it will work once only there will not validation in production.
rerender happend when state changes

Oracle Connection : 
connection = await oracle.getConnection({
    user: "hr",
    password: "hr",
    connectionString: "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=xepdb1)))"
});

connection string might be like sqlplus hr/hr@//localhost:1521/xepdb1
